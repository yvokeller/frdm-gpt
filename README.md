# frdm-GPT

Fun sunday project, implementing a "Attention Is All You Need"-style GPT model, after reading the paper for the first time. I based this on Andrej Karpathy's great "Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out" lecture available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t), with a little twist:

I am using the text of my 2017 german fantasy novel "ANSTURM" as the dataset.

Let's see what the model comes up with. Maybe I can even write the sequel with it's help :)

## The book

In case you are interested: My novel is available as an e-book on Amazon, Apple Books, Google Play Books, Thalia, Weltbild, Hugendubel, and many more. Just search for ANSTURM by Yvo K.

Or, even better - Get it directly in my shop: [ANSTURM](https://frdmauthor.net/shop/)
